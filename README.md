# embryo-project
This project focuses on classifying embryo development stages using microscopic images through a hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and traditional machine learning techniques. It aims to assist in improving IVF outcomes by providing accurate, automated, and interpretable embryo grading.
